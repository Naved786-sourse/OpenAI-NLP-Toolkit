Our vehicle  \\narchitecture and design philosophy are aimed at driving productivity and \\nreturning capital to our customers, and we  \\nbelieve the software and technology capabilities we are developing, \\npackaged around a modular, customizable  \\nproduct, have the potential to empower the customer experience across a \\nvehicle’s lifecycle. We remain committed  \\nto the environment and to delivering sustainable mobility that is \\naccessible to everyone. We proudly intend to  \\nmanufacture our fully electric vehicles in Oklahoma, bringing advanced \\nmanufacturing and technology jobs to  \\ncommunities in America's heartland. We are committed to building a \\ndiverse workforce that will draw heavily  \\nupon the local communities of Native Americans and veterans.  \\nRecent Developments  \\nVehicle Manufacturing Facility Lease  \\nOn April 7, 2023, we executed a ten year lease agreement with a five year \\nrenewal option (the C  \\n“ anoo Lease”)  \\nfor the leaseback of approximately 500,000 square feet of the vehicle \\nmanufacturing facility in Oklahoma City,  \\nOklahoma (the “OKC Facility”) from I -40 OKC Partners LLC, a special \\npurpose vehicle managed by entities  \\naffiliated with Mr. Tony Aquila, our Executive Chairman and Chief \\nExecutive Officer (“I -40 Partners”).

The Canoo Lease includes a $6.7 million tenant \\nimprovement fund and a separate $1.6  \\nmillion remediation fund for facility repairs. As required under the \\nterms of the PSA, I -40 Partners leased the  \\nremaining approximately 150,000 square feet of the OKC Facility to Terex \\nwho will continue operating in a  \\ndesignated area within the OKC Facility (the “Terex Lease”). Upon \\ntermination or expiration of the Terex Lease,  \\nwe shall lease the designated area within the OKC Facility allocated to \\nthe Terex Lease at the then -current rate  \\nprovided under the Terex Lease. We also maintain an option to purchase \\nthe OKC Facility from I -40 Partners  \\ncommencing in Year 3 of the Canoo Lease and ending prior to Year 4.
